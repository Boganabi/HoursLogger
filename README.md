# HoursLogger

## How to use
1. Download the repository to your PC. The top right button should allow for those options.
2. Unzip the file (right click, click 'extract all')
3. Double click on the `.bat` file. This should run command prompt.
- On Linux/MacOS, you may need to change it from a `.bat` file to a `.sh` file. I have yet to test this, but you may also need to open your terminal, and `cd` into your folder where this is stored. Then, you will probably need to run `chmod +rx runScraper.sh`
- If it keeps asking you to install python, uninstall your current version of python and reinstall, and check the box that adds python to PATH
4. Enter in the information as prompted. **Make sure to read the prompts carefully.**
5. You will need to sign in to MyCoyote after the chrome window opens up. 
6. Once the hours have been entered on the timesheet, double check the information, and correct necessary things.
7. Once you are sure all the information is correct, attach your class schedule and sign.
